# MIT - LICENSE Generator
Simple, you run main.py and you got yourself an LICENSE.md file with the MIT LICENSE in it.

Note that you have to change NAME variable inside main.py to have your name in the license.

If you are running linux you can create an alias to have it ran everywhere from the computer.
